# WIDGETARIO 
The Widgetario Kubernetes Hackathon is a hands-on, multi-part lab series designed to teach and challenge you on Kubernetes concepts through a realistic microservices app deployment. It’s structured like a real-world DevOps project — and by working through it, you practice deploying, scaling, configuring, and securing an app in a production-style cluster.
